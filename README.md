What is partial permutation?
Ordering only k objects out of n where k<n is defined as the partial permutation.

In what context, do we need partial permutation?
Since we assume that similar species share some common genes with possible mutations/modifications, we would like to take all possible modifications into account by calculating partial permutation.

This program accepts the value of n and k as the input, then it calculates the the partial permutation of k out of n which is the number of different possible orderings allowed for the gene.
